# Signal data (raw)

Based on (Tutorial > Inserting data into the dataset)[https://docs.atriumdb.io/tutorial.html#inserting-data-into-the-dataset].

The example scripts here do NOT include any factors that accomodate for digitisation of the data i.e. the data added is raw.

From root of project, run:
```
python src/signal_data/write_data.py
python src/signal_data/read_data_sample.py
```
